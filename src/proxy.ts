/**
 * Host-based routing for the five-subdomain platform, plus path-based routing
 * as a fallback.
 *
 * NOTE ON THE FILENAME: Next.js 16 deprecated `middleware.ts` in favour of
 * `proxy.ts` (and the named export `middleware` → `proxy`). Unlike middleware,
 * proxy runs on the **Node.js** runtime and that is not configurable.
 *
 *   hunt.example.com/clue/3  →  rewrite → /hunt/clue/3   → app/(hunt)/...
 *   ctf.example.com/         →  rewrite → /ctf           → app/(ctf)/...
 *   app.example.com/enter    →  passthrough              → app/(app)/enter
 *
 * The rewrite is invisible to the user: the URL bar keeps the pretty
 * subdomain form while Next resolves a normal nested route.
 *
 * PATH-BASED ROUTING exists because not every deployment has subdomains.
 * localhost and ngrok serve everything from one host, so `/ctf` and `/quiz`
 * must be gated on the path alone. `PROTECTED_PREFIXES` is what makes those
 * reachable-but-authenticated when `eventFromHost` returns null.
 *
 * AUTH HERE IS OPTIMISTIC ONLY. Per the Next docs, proxy shouldn't be treated
 * as the authorization boundary — it exists to bounce logged-out users to the
 * entry page cheaply. Every route handler that mutates state re-verifies the
 * session itself (see `requireSession`). Losing that second check would be a
 * real vulnerability, not a style issue.
 */

/**
 * The admin console lives at an unguessable path rather than `/admin`. This is
