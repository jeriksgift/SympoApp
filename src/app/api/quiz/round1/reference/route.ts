 * `public/`, so there is no path to guess and nothing to hotlink. What it
 * hands back is deliberately NOT the master: `referenceDisplayDataUrl` is a
 * downscaled, re-encoded copy, good enough to recreate from and useless as a
 * substitute for the original. The master (`referenceDataUrl`) stays on the
 * server for the vision judge and is never serialised into a response.
 *
 * Every hand-out is stamped with a fresh session id, logged against the team.
 * That id is burnt into the watermark the browser draws, so a leaked
 * screenshot names the team that was holding it — the honest protection here
 * is traceability, not prevention. A browser cannot stop an OS screenshot or
 * a phone camera, and nothing below pretends otherwise.
