 * weighted total can only land on `(sum of weights) * 10 + 1` distinct values.
 * The previous five criteria summed to weight 10 — exactly 101 possible scores,
 * so across a 60-team field ties were near-certain however many decimal places
 * the number carried. These weights sum to 23, giving 231 distinct totals, and
 * the uneven spread (5,4,3,3,2,2,2,1,1) means different combinations of
 * criteria land on different totals far more often than they collide.
 *
 * It is also a better rubric on its own terms. Each entry is a question a judge
 * can answer by looking, and a model asked nine specific questions produces
 * more defensible scores than one asked for a single overall impression. Every
 * digit of the final mark traces back to a judgement that was actually made,
 * which is what matters when a team disputes their score.
