/**
 * The four Spider-Verse identities, and the physical coins that hand them out.
 *
 * A team is given a 3D-printed coin stamped with a two-digit number. The
 * number's RANGE decides the character. This is what the rules doc's "each
 * team logs in using its assigned token" means here: the coin IS the token —
 * one physical object is the ticket, the identity and the theme.
 *
 * The coin is NOT a credential. Two digits is 60 possible values, so anyone
 * could type numbers until they landed in someone else's session. That's a
 * deliberate trade for a one-field entry screen at a supervised event with
 * physical discs handed out in person — the coordinator's own access code
 * (the `code` path on /api/enter) stays the thing that proves admin identity.

 * Highest coin that exists. Coins run 01..100.

 * This is the hard cap on how many teams can play, not a cosmetic limit:
 * `parseCoin` refuses anything above it and the entry page and `/api/enter`
 * both go through that, so a team holding coin 61 could not log in at all while
 * this read 60. Raised for Round 1 running at 100 teams (the field is cut to 60
 * for Rounds 2 and 3, which needs no change — fewer teams is always fine).
 *
 * The seed sizes the `coins` collection from this constant, so raising it and
 * re-seeding is what actually creates the extra tokens.
 *
 * Twelve characters now cover 100 coins rather than 60, so roughly eight teams
 * share each hero instead of five. `avatarForCoin`'s `(coin * 7) % 12` still
 * gives consecutive coins different characters — 7 and 12 are coprime — which
 * is the property that mattered; verified across 1..100 with zero consecutive
 * collisions.
