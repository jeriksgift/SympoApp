/**
 * Generate the dither frames on the SERVER, so a clean image never reaches the
 * browser at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The dither used to be applied in the browser, to an image
 * the server had already sent in the clear: `/api/quiz/round1/reference`
 * returned the picture as a data URL and the canvas noised it afterwards. That
 * protects a screenshot of the screen and nothing else — DevTools' Network tab
 * still held a pristine copy, one right-click from being saved. A team never
 * had to beat the flicker; they had to open the inspector.
 *
 * Moving generation here closes it. The client is sent only the finished
 * frames, each of which is individually unreadable, and there is no request
 * that returns anything better. The clean pixels exist on the server and are
 * discarded before the response is written.
 *
 * The frame maths is unchanged — `compressRange` and `ditherFrames` are the
 * same functions the browser was running, operating on the same
 * `Uint8ClampedArray`. They were already free of any DOM dependency, so this is
 * a change of WHERE the work happens, not WHAT it computes. A frame set built
 * here averages to the image exactly as one built in the browser did.
 *
 * COST, stated plainly. The response carries `frameCount` images instead of
 * one, so roughly double the bytes at the default of 2. Generation is real CPU
 * per request, which is why callers cache — see the route. PNG, not JPEG:
 * the frames are high-frequency noise, which is the worst case for a DCT codec
 * both in size and in fidelity, and lossy artefacts would break the property
 * that the frames average back to the image.
