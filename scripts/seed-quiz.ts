// assets repo's anonymised PLACEHOLDER frames, reused across all 5 puzzles
// for local testing only — per the repo's own README, which puzzle number
// means which subject is the coordinator's call, never committed or
// filename-encoded (a labelled filename would just hand the answer to
// anyone reading the network tab). Swap the artwork and answers for the real
// assignment before the event.
// NOTE: this file runs main() unconditionally at import time (see the bottom
// of the file), so it must never be `import`-ed by another script — that
// would re-run the seed as a side effect. scripts/verify-quiz.ts duplicates
// these literals for that reason; keep them in sync by hand.
